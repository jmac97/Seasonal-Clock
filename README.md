This seasonal calendar displays the traditional East Asian calendar, which was based on the climate and natural phenomena that occurred throughout the year. The LCD displays the current date in English and translates the current seasonal date. As the seasons change, the dial will rotate to the current season accordingly.

The clock uses a RTC to keep track of the date and time. An Arduino then uses this information to display the correct information on the LCD as well as spin a stepper motor to move the dial accordingly.
